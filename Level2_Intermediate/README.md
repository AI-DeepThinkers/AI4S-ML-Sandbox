# ðŸŸ  Level 2 â€“ Machine Learning

This level covers supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks using cleaned datasets.

---

## Task 2: Classification
- Model: Logistic Regression (with option to test others)
- Dataset: Iris (`iris_cleaned.csv`)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix

---

## Task 3: K-Means Clustering
- Preprocess numeric features with `StandardScaler`
- Determine optimal `k` with Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Visualize with PCA in 2D
- Cluster-wise feature averages displayed
